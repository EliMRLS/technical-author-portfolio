# Understanding the Diátaxis Documentation Framework

Modern software documentation often fails not because it lacks detail, but because it lacks structure. The Diátaxis framework provides a powerful way to organize technical documentation according to the needs and intentions of the reader.

This page explains the core ideas behind Diátaxis and why it helps create better, more usable documentation.

## What Is Diátaxis?

Diátaxis is a documentation framework that divides content into four distinct types:

1. **Tutorials** – learning-oriented  
2. **How-to Guides** – goal-oriented  
3. **Reference** – information-oriented  
4. **Explanation** – understanding-oriented

Each type serves a different user need. Mixing them leads to confusion and poor user experience.

## The Four Types Explained

### 1. Tutorials — *Learning by doing*

Tutorials guide users through a sequence of steps to help them learn something new. They are aimed at beginners and focus on building confidence and mental models.

> Example: “Getting Started with MkDocs”

---

### 2. How-to Guides — *Solving a specific problem*

How-to guides are recipes. They are focused, procedural documents that show how to accomplish a specific goal. They assume some prior knowledge.

> Example: “How to Write a Functional Specification”

---

### 3. Reference — *Consulting definitive information*

Reference documentation is technical and factual. It provides details that can be looked up, such as configuration options, API specs, or templates. It is not meant to be read top-to-bottom.

> Example: “Functional Specification Template”

---

### 4. Explanation — *Understanding the concept*

Explanation content provides background, theory, and context. It answers the *why* behind the software, the feature, or the decision. It helps users understand the system at a deeper level.

> This current page is itself an example of an Explanation.

## Why Diátaxis Matters

Most documentation mixes styles without realizing it. A page that starts as a how-to guide might drift into explanation or reference, confusing the reader.

By separating documentation types, Diátaxis helps:

- Match content to user needs
- Improve discoverability
- Support learning and problem-solving
- Clarify the voice and purpose of each document

---

## Applying Diátaxis in Practice

To apply the Diátaxis model, ask:

- Is the reader trying to **learn**, **do**, **look up**, or **understand**?
- Does the document stick to one of these goals?
- Are the four types clearly separated and discoverable?

The result is a more intentional and usable documentation system that respects the user's context.
