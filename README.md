# Technical Documentation Portfolio

This repository contains a sample documentation site structured using the **Diátaxis framework** (Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, and Explanations).

It was built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, to demonstrate proficiency in technical writing tools and documentation best practices.

- **How-To Guide** – Guide to writing a functional specification document.
- **Reference** – A reusable template for writing specs.
- **Explanation** – Conceptual introduction to the Diátaxis documentation framework.

Each page is available under the `docs/` directory.
